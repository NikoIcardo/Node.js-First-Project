# Node.js-First-Project
 An Introductory Project into Node.js

The project is more intended to be a beginner's playground to get myself acquainted with the basic functionality of node.js. 
The project simply lists three different ways to write a basic server to listen for user input into an input element and then return the user's input. 

Items used here: 
- FileSystem: 'fs'
- HTTP interface
- body-parser
- Nodemon for dev purposes
- package.json scripts
